# Next.js Application Build Error: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose bug in Next.js applications. The application fails to render correctly due to an unexpected error during the build process.  The error message is often unclear and doesn't provide a clear path to the root cause.

## Problem Description
The issue involves a subtle error in the application's logic or configuration that manifests only during the build process.  This could be due to a number of factors such as incorrect data fetching, issues with environment variables, or problems with dependencies.

## Solution
The solution involves careful debugging and examination of the build logs. This often requires checking for errors in the console during the `next build` process as well as examining any warning messages.  It's crucial to check both the client-side and server-side code for errors.  Inspecting the resulting build artifacts can also aid in identifying the problem.
